Lisp In Clojure (lic).

This is a tiny lisp that implements macros! This project was meant to learn how one could implement macros in a simple and concise way.

### run lic REPL

This assumes you have [babashka](https://babashka.org/) installed.

```sh
bb -m lic
```

You should take a look at [lic.clj](./lic.clj)! The code is simple and should be understandable if you are at least somewhat familiar with clojure (or any other lisp). There is a large comment block at the end containing many examples.
